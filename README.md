### Goal
Survive as long as you can! Falling Valley is an infinite scroller in which the player must get their character survive for as long as they can without getting hit. The higher you go, the better the score.

#### How to Play
1. At the home screen, you have the play and characters buttons
    * Play will take you directly into the game
    * Characters allows you to choose a different skin for the character you want to play
2. Once you start playing, your character spawns on the rope, where they cannot fall, and only slowly move up
3. As the time starts, rocks will begin to fall from three different places on the screen, move to avoid them
    * Use swiping to move from side to side
4. When your character is off the rope, they are in the hands of gravity, make sure they jump up the walls to avoid falling off the sides!
    * Tap to jump when off the rope
5. A timer is there to keep track of how long you can survive! See what the best time you can get is.
    * As time goes on, the more frequently that rocks will fall
